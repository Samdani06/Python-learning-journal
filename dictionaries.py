# Dictionaries : Python dictionary is a data structure that stores the value
# in key and keys cant be repeated and must be immutable.

# How to create Dictionaries :
# we can create dictionaries by adding all the elements in the curly {}
# brackets and by keeping a comma between them.
d1 = {1: 'notes', 2: 'books', 3: 'materials'}
print(d1)

# create dictionary using dict() constructor
d2 = dict(a="notes", b="books", c="materials")
print(d2)

# we use get() function to access an value in the operation.

# Removing Dictionary Items
# We can remove items from dictionary using the following methods:
# del: Removes an item by key.
# pop(): Removes an item by key and returns its value.
# clear(): Empties the dictionary.
