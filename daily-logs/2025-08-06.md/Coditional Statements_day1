## Today I started my Python journey by diving into conditional statements â€” a fundamental concept that allows decision-making in code.

## Topics Covered:
## if statements: Executing code blocks based on a condition.

## elif (else if): Handling multiple conditions.

## else: Catching all cases not handled by if or elif.

## Nested if statements: Using conditional logic inside another condition.

### THE CODES HIGHLIGHTS ARE:
   # Basic if statement
a = 80
b = 55
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")

# if-elif structure
a = 20
b = 20
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
elif a == b:
    print("a is Equal to b")

# if-elif-else structure
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
else:
    print("a is greater than b")

# Nested if statements
x = 45
if x > 10:
    print("Above ten,")
    if x > 20:
        print("and also above 20!")
    else:
        print("but not above 20.")

###ðŸ’¡ What I Have Learned through todays progress:
How to control the flow of a Python program using conditional logic.

How Python evaluates each condition in order.

Writing cleaner and more readable decision-based logic.
